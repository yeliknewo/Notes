OSI Network Model
	Network
		Forwarding and Routing
            Forwarding
                Local Direction
    			Forwarding Table
                    Generated by Routing Algorithms
    				?
            Routing
                End to End
    			Routing Algorithms
                    RIP
                    OSPF
                    BGP
                    ICMP Error reporting
    				?
			?
		Fragmentation
			MTU
				Max transmission unit
				Varies based on connection type
					?
			Structure of Fragment Data
				Size should be a multiple of 8
				Offset should be divisible by 8
                FragFlag = 1 when not end of a fragment
				?
			Reassembly of nodes
					?
		IP Addressing
			IPv4
				Hierarchical
				Subnet
					Sometimes called the network mask
					Network
					Host
					Mask
						Network bits = 1
						Host bits = 0
						Bitwise AND to get Network address
						Bitwise NAND to get Host address
					CIDR Notation
                        Classless InterDomain Routing
						/Number, Number = bits it network address part
					Interface
					NIC
					Broadcast IP
						Host is all 1s
						Sent to all
                    Network Address
                        Host is all 0s
					Range of a single network
						Based on how many bits the host has - 2
				?
			IPv6
				No Fragmentation
				No Checksum
				Options outside of Header
                    Next Header Field
				128 Bit
				2^128 addresses
				8 groups of 16 bits
				8 groups of 4 hex digits
                Datagram Format
                    Priority
                        Priority of Datagrams in flow
                    Flow Label
                        Flow ID
                    Next Header
                        Leads to Options
				Zeros shit
					Remove all leading zeros in a group
					1 block of consecutive zeros can be replaced with ::
				Not Hierarchical
				No Subnet

	Data Link
		Packets in a LAN
		Does not send across internet
		Network Switches connect all devices in a subnet
		Collision Handling
			Wait double time each time it doesn't work
			Exponential Back off
			Use a switch with ports so they can find each other
			Hosts have a table of hosts and Ethernet address
		Primary Protocol is Ethernet
		ARP
			Address Resolution Protocol
			IPv4 to Mac Address
		Mac Address = Ethernet Address
		Framing
			Adding the link layer header to a network layer datagram
		Link Access
			Medium Access Control
            Transmit a frame onto a link
		Reliable Delivery
			Link-layer protocol guarantees delivery across links without error. Used for error prone links
		Error Detection and Correction
			Implemented in Hardware
		Implemented in NIC
			NIC = Network Adapter
		Addressing
			Ethernet Interface has 48 Bit Address
			6 groups of 2 hex digits
			No Shortening
			No structure or subnets
		Broadcast Address
			FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
			Used for ARP
			Sent to all under same router
			Hosts and Routers have NIC
				NIC have LL Addresses
		Switch has tables
			Address
				MAC Address
			Port
				Port on Switch
            No Need for collision detection
